# Java-Micro-Service-framework(java)

A micro-service framework implementation of an online book store with a delivery option.
In the Micro-Services architecture, complex applications are composed of small and independent services which are able to communicate with each other using messages. The Micro-Service architecture allows us to compose a large program from a collection of smaller independent parts.

This project is composed of two main sections:

Building a simple Micro-Service framework.
Implementing an online books store application on top of this framework.
